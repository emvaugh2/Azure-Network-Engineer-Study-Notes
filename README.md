## Azure Network Engineer (AZ-700)

**I'm going to also publicly document my notes for the Azure Network Engineer certification (AZ-700) exam. I'm currently applying for cloud engineer roles so I think this will augment my skills in the meantime. I definitely want to take this exam but I'll probably do that after I actually get the job.**
